An extremely condensed version of the OpenGL / SDL application framework I'm currently working on, except written in C. The code is very messy and a few things have been modified before being dumped on GitHub. Additionally, the updates I push to GitHub will be few and far between, but it's not like anyone is gonna' care about that.

Currently, I'm building each individual element before I tie everything in together. My to-do list is to merge models and sprites into a "renderable" struct, create an "entity" struct that holds any number of renderables, add support for loadResources.tad, add an asset handler struct and... well, that's all I can remember at this time.

Download the bin folder if you want to give it a go.
