An extremely condensed version of the OpenGL / SDL application framework I'm currently working on, but written in C. The code is very messy and a few things have been modified before being dumped on GitHub. The updates I push to GitHub may be few and far between.

My current "to-do list" (from what I can remember, at least) is as follows:
* Add an entity struct that contains groups of renderables
* Sprites should use index buffer objects like models
* Create an asset handler
* Renderable / scene files and file parsing
* Bone system for model animations
* Clean up a large number of functions

Download the bin folder if you want to give it a go.
