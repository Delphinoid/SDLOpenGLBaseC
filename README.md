An extremely condensed version of the OpenGL / SDL application framework I'm currently working on, but written in C. The code is very messy and a few things have been modified before being dumped on GitHub. The updates I push to GitHub may be few and far between.

List of features to be implemented:
* Add an entity struct that contains groups of renderables.
* Cameras should contain a pointer to a scene, and the render code should aim at rendering camera views.
* Sprites should use index buffer objects like models.
* Create file formats and loading code for the various skeleton structures, renderables, entities and scenes.
* Create an asset handler.
* Create a proper framerate handler / state interpolator.

List of queued tweaks:
* Models need to store their own skeletal data.
* Phase out cVector (only skeletons use them now).
* Clean up renderable struct and remove any unnecessary member variables. Currently the only real member variables I am not happy with are sprite and hudElement.
* Fix up render and space transform structures and unify all animation / interpolation code.
* Not happy with the current billboard system, not sure why.
* A large number of functions need to be cleaned up. Look for comments starting with /**.
* Generate a transformation matrix for sprites in rndrGenerateSprite(). Don't use matrices, they should be unnecessary.
* I still don't like passing allTextures into twLoad().
* Organize source files into folders. Eventually.
* Phase out SDL?
